# Pixma IX6850 Troubleshooting guide

### Not registering an ink cartridge

#### Timeout method
- When a particular color ink cartridge is playing up, it can help to unseat the ink cartridge, turn off the printer and unplug it and wait for 5 minutes. This can give the printer chance for the ARC (auto reset chip) to reset, allowing the ink to be recognised by the printer.
- Plug back in the printer and reseat the ink cartridge back into the printer.
- You can additionally turn the printer off and unplug again with the reseated ink cartridge back in the printer.


### Alignment
- Hold down the x button until the power button flashes 4 times.
